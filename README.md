# Long-term Action Forecasting Using Multi-headed Attention-based Variational Recurrent Neural Networks (MAVAP)
Pytorch implementation of MAVAP, a probablistic neural network archicture for action forecasting from videos. This piece of work was presented at the 3rd Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW), which was hosted at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference in 2022.
